### Introduction

Prostitution has evolved with technology, shifting from traditional methods to online platforms. Social media, live streaming, and dating sites now play a major role in facilitating prostitution. These platforms provide anonymity and convenience for sex workers and clients alike but also pose challenges for law enforcement.

### Online Platforms and Their Role

#### Social Media

Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are used to create individual profiles and attract clients. These platforms allow sex workers to interact with clients directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

#### Live Streaming and Video

Sex workers now utilize live streaming apps to offer personalized services. Clients can interact with sex workers directly, often increasing the demand for live and real-time services.

#### Dating and Escort Websites

Webcam and dating sites provide another avenue for prostitution. These platforms often blur the line between consensual work and trafficking, making it difficult to regulate.

### The Link to Trafficking

Prostitution and trafficking are closely linked. Many victims of trafficking are forced into prostitution. This link is often exploited by online platforms, making it harder to identify and rescue victims.

### Harms of Prostitution and Trafficking

Prostitution impacts the physical and mental health of sex workers. Many suffer from PTSD and face societal stigma. Trafficking victims endure further abuse, compounding their trauma.

### Legal Challenges

Laws targeting prostitution and trafficking vary by country. In India, legal provisions aim to suppress prostitution but often fall short in addressing the nuances of online exploitation. Global conventions like CEDAW and the CRC focus on protecting victims but require stronger enforcement mechanisms.

### Conclusion

The shift to online prostitution has created significant challenges for law enforcement. While technology has provided new tools for sex workers, it has also enabled trafficking and exploitation. A multi-faceted approach involving law enforcement, rehabilitation, and policy changes is essential to address these issues effectively.
